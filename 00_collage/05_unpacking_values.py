# if we have a sequence of data then we can store it in multiple variable at one line

odd_num = [1,3,5,]

# now i can store each values to the diffrent varibales

# a , b, c = odd_num
# print(a,b,c)

# # =======================

# a = odd_num
# print(a)

# +================================

even_num = [2,4,6]

# a , b = even_num[0,1]
# not working

a,b= even_num[0:2]
print(a)
print(b)
print(a,b)
